# Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Blyxyas, a front end web developer, and currently documenting about Neural Networks, Spanish and with so much love for cats, I love them, they're so squishy and cute, just see these images!

If you're like asking yourself who I am (probably not) then I'm gonna answer you!

I'm a Spanish student with high expectations and with a dream, converting myself into a professional in a Full Stack programmer.

Bye!
